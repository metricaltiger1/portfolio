        <h3>A Cybersecurity & Software Development Professional</h3>
        <p>
          A motivated and committed student at Daystar University pursuing a
          degree in Applied Computer Science with a keen interest in
          cybersecurity. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, C,
          C++, and Java, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve
          complex problems while ensuring security and resilience in digital
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through in-depth study, hands-on projects, and security-focused
          learning, I have developed expertise in data structures, algorithms,
          web development, and fundamental cybersecurity concepts such as
          network security, encryption, and ethical hacking.
